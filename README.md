# Diabetes Prediction API

## Introduction

This repository contains a diabetes prediction model built with Python and deployed as an API using FastAPI. The model leverages various medical parameters to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients. The API provides endpoints for making predictions and can be easily integrated with other applications.

## Features

- **Model**: The diabetes prediction model is built using machine learning techniques.
- **API**: The model is deployed as a RESTful API using FastAPI.
- **Endpoints**: The API includes endpoints for health check and making predictions.
- **Integration**: The API can be easily integrated with other applications for real-time predictions.

## Libraries Used

- **FastAPI**: For building the API.
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for running the FastAPI application.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and training the machine learning model.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations.
